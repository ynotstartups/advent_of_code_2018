# advent_of_code_2018

This is my first time of playing advent of code, so the code is not very organised and the answer doesn't seperate between part1 and part2...

Also, since day 13, I have started learning Rust and turns out using advent of code's questions to learn a new language is extremely fun! (Thanks to the suggestion by my colleagues, D and H)

If you would like to run the code (Not suggested).
```
cd in/to/directory
```
Either
```
python3 calc.py
```
OR 
```
cargo run
```
